/*
Write a function, "persistence", that takes in a positive parameter "num"
and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times
you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

Examples:
persistence(39) === 3 
Because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4 and 4 has only one digit

persistence(999) === 4 
Because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and 1*2 = 2
*/

function persistence(num) {
    let arr = Array.from(String(num), Number);
    console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
